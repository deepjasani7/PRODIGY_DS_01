# Population Data Visualization

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a project focused on visualizing population data. Specifically, it involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as population distribution across countries or over time, using a dataset of world population data.

## Files in the Repository
- **worldpopulationdata.csv**: The dataset used for the visualization. It contains population data for various countries from 2001 to 2022.
- **Task_1.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains Python code for creating visualizations (bar chart or histogram) to explore the distribution of a specific variable (such as population by country or year) in the dataset.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset (`worldpopulationdata.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `Series Name`: The type of data being recorded (e.g., "Total Population").
- `Series Code`: A unique code representing the data series.
- `Country Name`: The name of the country.
- `Country Code`: The ISO country code (e.g., "USA" for the United States).
- **Population data from 2001 to 2022**: The columns for each year (2001â€“2022) represent the population count of the respective country for that year.

### Example Dataset Structure:
| Series Name      | Series Code | Country Name | Country Code | 2001   | 2002   | ... | 2022   |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|--------|-----|--------|
| Total Population | SP.POP.TOTL | United States| USA          | 285083 | 287803 | ... | 332403 |
| Total Population | SP.POP.TOTL | India        | IND          | 105305 | 107551 | ... | 140663 |
| ...              | ...         | ...          | ...          | ...    | ...    | ... | ...    |

### Key Information:
- The dataset provides **year-wise population data** for different countries from 2001 to 2022.
- The dataset allows for visualizing trends over time or comparing population sizes across different countries.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to create visualizations of the distribution of population data from the dataset. The focus is on:
- **Bar Chart**: For visualizing population distributions across countries for a particular year.
- **Histogram**: For visualizing continuous data, such as population changes over a range of years.

### Steps in the Notebook:
1. **Data Loading**: Load the population dataset from the CSV file using Python's `pandas` library.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Data Exploration**: Explore the data structure, including basic summary statistics.
4. **Visualization**:
   - **Bar Chart**: Create a bar chart to display population distribution across different countries in a specific year.
   - **Histogram**: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of population growth over the years or across countries.
5. **Insights**: Interpret the visualizations, highlighting key population trends and differences between countries.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepjasani7/PRODIGY_DS_01/tree/main
